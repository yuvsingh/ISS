              <h2>ISS Facts</h2> 
              The ISS stands for internatonal space station.
              The space station is the first space station the U.S ever launched.
              It weighs 925,335 pounds (419,725 kilograms). 
              <h2>More Facts</h2>
              Pressurized Module Length: 218 feet along the major axis (67 meters)
              Truss Length: 310 feet (94 meters)
              Solar Array Length: 239 feet across both longitudinally aligned arrays (73 meters).
              Habitable Volume: 13,696 cubic feet (388 cubic meters) not including visiting vehicles.
              Pressurized Volume: 32,333 cubic feet (916 cubic meters).
              With BEAM expanded: 32,898 cubic feet (932 cubic meters).
              Power Generation: 8 solar arrays provide 75 to 90 kilowatts of power.
              Lines of Computer Code: approximately 1.5 million.
              243 individuals from 19 countries have visited the International Space Station
              The space station has been continuously occupied since November 2000
              An international crew of six people live and work while traveling at a speed of five miles per second, orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes.
              In 24 hours, the space station makes 16 orbits of Earth, traveling through 16 sunrises and sunsets.
              Peggy Whitson set the U.S. record for spending the most total time living and working in space at 665 days on Sept. 2, 2017.
              The acre of solar panels that power the station means sometimes you can look up in the sky at dawn or dusk and see the spaceship flying over your home, even if you live in a big city. 
              The living and working space in the station is larger than a six-bedroom house (and has six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree view bay window).
              To mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass in the human body in microgravity, the astronauts work out at least two hours a day.
              Astronauts and cosmonauts have conducted 232 spacewalks (and counting!) for space station construction, maintenance and upgrades since December 1998.
              The solar array wingspan (356 feet, 109 meters) is longer than the worldâ€™s largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380 (262 feet, 80 meters).
              The large modules and other pieces of the station were delivered on 42 assembly flights, 37 on the U.S. space shuttles and five on Russian Proton/Soyuz rockets.
              The space station is 356 feet (109 meters) end-to-end, one yard shy of the full length of an American football field including the end zones.
              Eight miles of wire connects the electrical power system aboard the space station.
              The 55-foot robotic Canadarm2 has seven different joints and two end-effectors, or hands, and is used to move entire modules, deploy science experiments and even transport spacewalking astronauts.
              Eight spaceships can be connected to the space station at once.
             A spacecraft can arrive at the space station as soon as four hours after launching from Earth.
             <h2>The biggest spaceship in the world</h2>
             The ISS is the biggest spacecraft in the world.
             And it will stay that way until a bigger better on comes.
             <h2>Who created the station</h2>

             The organisers who created the space station is Nasa,Eesa,Roscosmos,JAXA,Boeing,CSA,TAS,Nanoracks, and Khartron.These are the peaople who built the internatinal space station. 
             
             <h2>what Day was it launched</h2>
            
             November 20, 1998
            
             <h2>How did they build the space station</h2>
             
             The International Space Station was taken into space piece-by-piece and gradually built in orbit using spacewalking astronauts and robotics. Most missions used NASA's space shuttle to carry up the heavier pieces, although some individual modules were launched on single-use rockets.

             <h2>when was it built</h2>
             
             March 29, 1963, Olbia, Italy
             
             <h2>why did they build it</h2>

             Purpose. The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and a low Earth orbit staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids.
